comp_help: Source port(s) can be specified as a comma-separated list of:
  <port name>           Named port (any name in /etc/services, e.g., http)
  <1-65535>             Numbered port
  <start>-<end>         Numbered port range (e.g., 1001-1005)
The whole list can also be "negated" using '!'. For example:
  '!22,telnet,http,123,1001-1005'
